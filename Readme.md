## About

Reloaded.Memory is a high performance library which provides `zero-cost abstractions` for memory manipulation in C#.  

It is designed to be as fast as possible, with no overhead, while providing useful functionality to the user.  

- **Zero Cost Abstractions:** Performance equivalent to using raw pointers.  
- **Stable API:** Versions 9.0.0 and above have a fully stable, backwards compatible API.  
- **Trimming Safe:** The library is fully compatible with .NET Core's Linker.  
- **Fully Documented:** The library is fully tested & documented with XML comments.  
- **Cross Platform:** 99% of the library is fully compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS.  
- **Large Address Aware:** The library can correctly leverage all 4GB in x86 processes.  

This project guarantees binary backwards compatibility; meaning you can substitute the library with any newer version
without recompiling the source code. Should the need to introduce any breaking changes occur; much like the runtime.

## Common Utilities

Common Classes within this Package Include:  

**Memory Manipulation:**  

| Action           | Description                                                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Memory`         | Allows you to Read, Write, Allocate & Change Memory Protection for Current Process. |
| `ExternalMemory` | Read, Write, Allocate & Change Memory Protection but for Another Process.           |

**Streams Management:**  

| Action                        | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `BigEndian(Reader/Writer)`    | Read/write raw data in memory as Big Endian.    |
| `LittleEndian(Reader/Writer)` | Read/write raw data in memory as Little Endian. |
| `BufferedStreamReader`        | High performance alternative to `BinaryReader`. |

**Extensions:**  

| Action                   | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `(Array/Span)Extensions` | Unsafe slicing, references without bounds checks and SIMD accelerated extensions. |
| `StreamExtensions`       | Extensions for reading and writing from/to generics.                              |
| `StringExtensions`       | Custom Hash Function(s) and unsafe character references.                          |

**Utilities:**  

| Action                             | Description                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ArrayRental` & `ArrayRentalSlice` | Safe wrapper around `ArrayPool<T>` rentals.                                            |
| `Box<T>`                           | Represents a boxed value type, providing build-time validation and automatic unboxing. |
| `CircularBuffer`                   | Basic high-performance circular buffer.                                                |
| `Pinnable<T>`                      | Utility for pinning C# objects for access from native code.                            |

**Base building blocks:**  

| Action                                          | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Ptr<T> / MarshalledPtr<T>`                     | Abstraction over a pointer to arbitrary source. |
| `FixedArrayPtr<T> & MarshalledFixedArrayPtr<T>` | Abstraction over a pointer with known length.   |
